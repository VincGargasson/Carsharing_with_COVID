## **README**


Carsharing has been deeply impacted with COVID like most of industries in the collaborative economy. 
In order to better understand the behaviour of the users of this service and find out drivers that could bring back the trend before covid, I have started
a data exploration with several opensource datasets.

This project starts with jupyter notebook to explore the data but will soon be available on a webapp to share it in a sexiest way with the rest of the world. <br />
